NAME
     Dircmp - Use in place of dircmp command

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Dircmp;

     dircmp("directory1", "directory2");

     The diffs are returned as an array of strings.

DESCRIPTION
     I wrote File::Dircmp so I would not have to use the dircmp
     command, diff -r --brief on systems without dircmp.

     The algorithm I use orders the report differently than the
     other commands.

TODO
          -d        Compare the contents of files with the  same  name
                    in both directories and output a list telling what
                    must be changed in the two  files  to  bring  them
                    into  agreement.  The  list format is described in
                    diff(1).

          -s        Suppress messages about identical files.

          -w n      Change the width of the output line to  n  charac-
                    ters. The default width is  72.
